<h2>A first attempt at a wearable that interacts with Android notifications and has a few other neat features.</h2>

Inspired by the NeoGeo watch featured in Make magazine, I set out to create my own Arduino powered watch. Watches are boring though, and I didn't see much need for a gps and compass in everyday use. Instead, I focused on making something that could help me instead of being a nuisance. Normal smartwatches, while a cool concept, are too expensive and generally lack any sort of customization. My goal was to build a watch that fell between the niche fitness trackers and full blown smartwatches. Using data sent by my phone, the Neopixel watch can display any notification, incoming calls, and precise time. It also features a timer with stop/start/reset, a calibrated uv brightness meter, a flashlight, and an auto-brightness function. 
Still in progress is an IR remote signal receiver and blaster, and music playback control using the button on the watch.
